## ⚡ Understand it in 90 seconds

### What it does

You drop a **yellow sticky note** on the n8n canvas and write (in any language):

```text
Every day at 9 AM, fetch sales data and email the daily report to my boss.
On failure, notify Slack #ops.
```

You ask AI to build it. The canvas now shows a complete workflow:

```
┌─ Yellow sticky: your requirement (preserved as-is)
├─ Middle: AI-generated nodes (Schedule → HTTP → Code → Email)
└─ Blue sticky: AI's notes (credentials needed, assumptions, limitations, how to test)
```

No code. No syntax to learn. No need to memorize n8n node names.

### Three usage modes (details in [02-USAGE-MODES.en.md](02-USAGE-MODES.en.md))

| Mode | When | Trigger phrase |
|---|---|---|
| 🪄 Cookbook copy | You know what you want, fast | Copy from [cookbook](cookbook/00-INDEX.en.md) |
| 💬 Q&A mode | You have no idea how to describe it | "enable Q&A mode" / "問答模式" |
| 🔍 Example finder | Want to see prior art first | "find examples for X" / "範例查詢" |

## 🛠️ Pain points this Pack solves

| Pain | Solution |
|---|---|
| AI-written workflows are inconsistent, hard to review | Enforce three-layer structure |
| Users don't know how to describe what they want | Plain-language stickies + 8 cookbooks + Q&A mode |
| AI doesn't know n8n well enough | 7 official Skills + 2,061 workflow corpus |
| No enterprise-grade patterns | 4 pillars: Atomic Orchestration / Universal Worker / SDD / Security |
| Don't know where to start | `03-FIRST-WORKFLOW.en.md` 15-min hands-on |
